# Advice Generator
This is an adapted solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. But this time I made a simpler version, specifically to train element placement using Flexbox on the CSS.
In the future I will add the Advice Slip API, making the App more interactive.
